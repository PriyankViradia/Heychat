# Heychat
Online chat may refer to any kind of communication over the Internet that offers a real-time transmission of text messages from sender to receiver.
Chat messages are generally short in order to enable other participants to respond quickly.
Thereby, a feeling similar to a spoken conversation is created, which distinguishes chatting from other text-based online communication forms such as Internet forums and email.
Online chat may address point-to-point communications as well as multicast communications from one sender to many receivers.
So, our goal is to make an Android chat application called Heychat.
In which user can chats with his or her friends which he or she can add him through their friend’s email id.
